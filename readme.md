# &nbsp;- ALL ABOUT AJAX and Node.js - âœ”

This "All about AJAX and Node.js"-repository catches up its focus on all the AJAX and Node.js processes I've made, commented and written through the years as a **SAE-Web Development** student with exercise lessons every week as well as tutorial videos on _Youtube_.

## AJAX and Node.js - Useful Assistance âœ…
***
``AJAX`` = Asynchronous* Javascript and XML 

_**Means:**_

*Asynchronous Request (Fetch = Vanilla, JQuery Ajax = JQuery, etc) and Responses.
XML = Obsolete, actually works like HTML. Through Json (text version of JS).

_**Used for:**_

 * Injecting content from a database / server (localhost e.g.) without refreshing the website every time.

 * Loading content into a web page from time to time. (Example: chatbots = refresh happens automatically)

 * Load webpage content when a button is clicked (e.g. "Show more" in a webshop).

_**Combined with:**_

 * Javascript or JQuery

_**Each browser has its own JS engine:**_

 * Engine: The engine that executes Javascript in the browser, in Chrome e.g. "V8".

_**AJAX IS: Stack Functionable / Single threaded / Never blocking / Asynchronous:**_
 * Each function is stacked (stacked) step by step = Javascript goes step by step through them all from the first function to the next.
to the next. 

* JS is single threaded = There is only one stack

* Never-Blocking = It is constantly looped through step by step

* Asynchronous = We have to wait until the process is executed. This varies depending on the content!
(With Ajax we can work side by side, making requests while processes are happening).
